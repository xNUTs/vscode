		- adapters sends InitializedEvent (after the InitializeRequest has returned)
		- frontend sends zero or more SetBreakpointsRequest
		- frontend sends one SetFunctionBreakpointsRequest
		- frontend sends a SetExceptionBreakpointsRequest if one or more exceptionBreakpointFilters have been defined (or if supportsConfigurationDoneRequest is not defined or false)
